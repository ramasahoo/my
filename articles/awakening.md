# Awakening Days

What a tremendous change !  
A wonderful feeling,I experience  
From my age ??   
Now I taste sweetness not in beauty  
Chant the psalm of purity .  
Unraptured to watch the red rose in bloom  
Rather in it's thorns for safety  
Not a child I am !   
To catch sight of a colourful rainbow  
Look and vanished abruptly  
I adore the black clouds giving pure water  
And lost in fresh air  
I pay little heed on fluttering butter fly  
Flapping dragon fly  
Or glowing glow worm   
A childish fun  
My ears are now on attempt to listen  
Sweet murmur of the brook   
Where words in deep sense flow day and night  
A melodious tune of the flute coming from  
 Above the sun and Galaxy  
The burden !
