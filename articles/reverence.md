## REVERENCE
<pre>
I have the honour
To the painter's brush
The sculptor's chisel
The poet's mighty pen,
A ruly role model .

I have the honour
To the soldiers arm
Their steely chest
Born for the nation
Serving at the life's cost
Aiming at the victory crest .

I have the honour
To the farmer's spade
His teethy scythe
Promising soul in honest breathe .

I have the honour
To the teacher's brain
The chalk that whitens
Children's gloomy head
Always a moving scripture
Leading the rest
To his ability best .

O nation making angels !
Hats off to your Noble cause
You are made in the heaven
And lo ! you are in thousands heart .
