## Scary Scare
<pre>
I have a fear of the teachers
Those who misguide the pupils,
Awaiting to be enlightened
In future,the safeguard of the nation .

I have a fear of the leaders
Those who mislead the people,
The real makers of the royal crown
Switch on the support to lead the throne.

I have a fear of the bureaucrats
Those who betray the public,
Obliged to water the plants of money
Streaming with care for monthly remuneration.

I have a fear of the citizens
Those who always claim for rights
And never aware of their duties and responsibilities
For building up an awakening generation .
