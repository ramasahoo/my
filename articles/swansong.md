## Swansong
<pre>
Swarms of misfortunes ! 
Around me,in a stinging mood
No arms at all to swat
They are many,armed with spearing pain
Am alone even with no sturdy cane 
Rightly said !
The swag on one's coronation
Sways in the air of despair
On the day of superannuation
Withered blooms.....!
In absence of nurture and light
Pass away before dreams of delight
Strange moment !!
Rushes and snatches away the chair .
Not a single face wants to care

Nevertheless ,
The ever flaming wick
Wavers away beyond reach so quick
No way to escape indeed !
Today's chair may be auctioned
In tomorrow's fair .
Adaptation to every mile
Learning a filament smile
To walk along the thorn paved way
To keep the life crawl
On the ladder of prosperity
With empty palms .
Singing swansong along with Psalms.
